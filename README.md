Peer Review: Griffin Parker

This program does what is advertised, but misses one point. The assignment calls for some sort of data validation.
There aren't many places where you'll have to validate data, but I think the user's input of their name and time they woke up
is where something should be validated. I think that the program should check to make sure the user hadn't input a blank entry when asked for their name/time. The repeat process at the end of the program works fine.
